#Simple Stuent Management System
#Single student enter name-surname
#Student can enter 3 wrong answers before system goes off
#After entering student can take min 3 max 5 courses
#If student take less than 3 classes he fails
#Then student should choise 1 couce to take exam. The student notes are predifned in dictionary
#Dictionary should contain midter, final, projcect
#Then the system will determine the grades
